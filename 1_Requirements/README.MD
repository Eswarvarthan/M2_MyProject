# EVALUATING CODE FOR LCDAND DATA ACQUISITION USING ATMEGA328

* General Objectives:
*  To evaluate and display any character on LCD
*  To develop and integrate AVR microcontroller and sensors for electronic meter or related data acquisition system

# Specific Objectives:
*  To integrate an LCD with AVR microcontroller that can display a string of characters using hexadecimal data values.
*  Implement a program code for ATMega328P to display the numbers 0 – 9 on the 16X2 LCD display using keypad. 
*  Implement a program code for ATMega328P to build a working 1 – digit calculator, by using A key as + and C key as =. 
*  Implement a program code for ATMega328P to build a working 1 – digit calculator, whereby the input can only be 1 – digit but cannot output 2 – digit results. 
*  Proposing a solution using AVR microcontroller and I/O components in SIMULIDE which can solve a practical problem.
*  Build a program code for ATMega328P that will implement a simple calculator with Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division Operator
